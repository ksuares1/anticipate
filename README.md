# Anticipate

Anticipate is a voice recording app that connects nurses and family members with patients. Nurses are able to sign-up and login to the patient database with back-end languages such as Node.js, Mongodb, and Mongoose. Passport.js is implemented to ensure the encryption and hashing of nurseâ€™s credentials. Patients' family members are able to view their family members medications through our database portal. We have implemented various coding languages on this project such as: Mongoose,React.Js, HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, Materialize, JavaScript, Jquery, Passport, Api/Ajax and more.
